## Introduction
**AutoDS** is an intelligent multi-agent system powered by LLMs, designed to streamline data analysis and research workflows. By leveraging LangChain and LangGraph, AutoDS orchestrates specialized agents that autonomously execute tasks such as statistical analysis, visualization, and report generation. Our system integrates cutting-edge models like DeepSeek and tools like WebUI for seamless interaction and deployment. AutoDS enhances the Data-to-Paper workflow by structuring it into a cohesive, automated pipeline, enabling AI-driven decision-making and workflow optimization. The ultimate vision is for AutoDS to operate as a fully autonomous research assistant, intelligently managing and refining analytical processes from start to finish.

## Setup Instructions


## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aneesh27/SuperPlannerV1.git
cd SuperPlannerV1
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\\Scripts\\activate
  ```
- **macOS / Linux**:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using `uv pip` (or `pip` if `uv` is not available):
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: If `uv` is not installed, use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.*

### 4. Create a `.env` File
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 5. Run the Application
Execute the main script to start the conversational agent:
```bash
python superPlanV3.py
```

---

## Command Reference

### Update `requirements.txt`
If youâ€™ve added a new dependency, update the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Useful Git Commands
- **Check Status**:
  ```bash
  git status
  ```
- **Add Changes**:
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
- **Commit Changes**:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  ```
- **Push Changes**:
  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```

## LangGraph Simple Agentic Structure Demo

This demo shows how to build an AI-driven research and reporting system using LangChain and LangGraph. It implements an agentic workflow where an AI supervisor works in tandem with a Plan and Execute structure to urilize tools effectively. The system dynamically plans, executes, and refines tasks using OpenAI's GPT models, ensuring an iterative and structured approach to problem-solving.
